Make sure to give the absolute path to the directory where you want to create your project.

```Python```

This will scaffold a project in the directory D:\test_project with the structure:

```
test_project/                      # The directory you provide
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                    # Contains your main application code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py                   # Sample utility functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ consts.py                  # Constants for your project
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                         # Unit tests go here
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw/                       # Raw data storage
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ processed/                 # Processed data storage
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/                     # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                          # Documentation (empty by default)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yaml                    # Configuration settings
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt               # Project dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                     # Specifies which files Git should ignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .flake8                        # flake8 linting config
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml                 # black code formatter config
```

ðŸ”¥ Bonus:

If git is accessible in your environment, the tool will also initialize a Git repository in the project directory and make an initial commit titled "Initial project setup."

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
